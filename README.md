# Fraud-Transaction-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-using-python
This project focuses on using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques to analyze a dataset related to bank loans with the aim of identifying potential fraudulent patterns. Python, along with Pandas and Matplotlib, will be employed to conduct the analysis.
Project Goals:

Data Collection: Gather a dataset containing information related to bank loans, which includes features such as loan amount, applicant demographics, financial history, and loan status.

Data Preprocessing: Prepare the dataset for analysis by handling missing values, outliers, and data types. This step is essential for ensuring the data's quality and reliability.

Exploratory Data Analysis: Utilize Python's Pandas library to perform in-depth exploratory data analysis. This includes:

a. Descriptive Statistics: Calculate basic statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, and quartiles for key variables to gain initial insights into the data.

b. Data Visualization: Create informative visualizations using Matplotlib to visualize the distribution of variables, detect anomalies, and explore relationships between features.

c. Feature Engineering: Derive new features or transform existing ones to extract meaningful information that might aid in fraud detection.

Fraud Detection: Develop preliminary fraud detection models or rules based on the patterns and insights obtained during the EDA process. This might involve setting thresholds, creating anomaly detection models, or identifying suspicious patterns.

Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the preliminary fraud detection models using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Visualization of Results: Use Matplotlib to visualize the results of the fraud detection models, showcasing how well they perform in identifying potential fraudulent cases.

Documentation: Maintain clear and concise documentation throughout the project, including code comments and a report summarizing the findings from EDA and fraud detection.

Tools and Technologies:

Python: Utilize Python as the primary programming language for data analysis and manipulation.
Pandas: Employ Pandas for data cleaning, transformation, and exploration.
Matplotlib: Create informative data visualizations to better understand the dataset and model results.
Jupyter Notebook: Use Jupyter Notebooks for interactive development and documentation.
